    <h2>Versions and document revision - SOW</h2>
<body>
<h4>Mark-up and Draft document status (notes)</h4>
<p>Planning documentation update integral to a project / Review Schedule / System or Business directive. The issue, publish or release which gathers the content of the document for review.</P>
<p>A document is to be updated or it is to be used for a purpose alternative to original scope.
A document is to be integrated into a greater or smaller information capacity.</p>
<p>Is the original content going to be re-structured? 
Is the content re-structure format (e.g, a new platform or publication) or content based (e.g, a new product version release or specification update) or both?</p>
<p>Is an update required to the original content or is the content to be adapted specifically to a new structure or information architecture? Is the content being published at v.01?</p>
<p>Will the updates required be incremental or block, such as Chapters?</p>
<p>What is the requirement for new content?</p>
<p>Updating, versioning, reviewing; What is a revision?, and when it is not a draft. These are all the ethical and questional attributes for a draft, for a document in draft and each subsequent draft, but before this happens (updating, verisoning...) the document has to be agreed as a document and it's content referenced or formulated for it to be updated, versioned, reviewed and revised.?  </p>
